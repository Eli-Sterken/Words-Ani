Words Ani is a fun little webpage that makes a word appear in a cool-looking way.
It is built mainly using JQuery

## How To Use
Install [This Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), then open the project folder.
Finally, click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner. Then go to [Localhost on port 5500](http://localhost:5500) and watch it work.

P.S - I may make it work with more words later, but i'm working on other things right now.
